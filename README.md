Tasks assessment for Fundamentals of Data Analysis module

This document consists of 4 assessments:

> Counts:

A Python function called counts that takes a list as input and returns a dictionary of unique items in the list as keys and the number of times each item appears as values.

> Dice-rolls:

A Python function called dicerolls that simulatesrolling dice. The function takes two parameters: the number of dice `k` and the number of times to roll the dice `n`, keeping track of each total face value. It returns a dictionary with the number of times each possible total face value occurred.

> The numpy.random.binomial:

A function can be used to simulate flipping a coin with a 50/50 chance of heads or tails. Interestingly, if a coin is flipped many times then the number of heads is well approximated by a bell-shaped curve. For instance, if we flip a coin 100 times in a row the chance of getting 50 heads is relatively high, the chances of getting 0 or 100 heads is relatively low, and the chances of getting any other number of heads decreases as we  move away from 50 in either direction towards 0 or 100.

> Simpson’s paradox:

A statistical paradox where a trend evident in a number of groups reverses when the groups are combined into one big data set. Using numpy to create four data sets, each with an x array and a corresponding y array, to demonstrate Simpson’s paradox.


To run the Jupyter Notebook:

Initially you should have no issues to view the contents of the file Tasks.ipynb that contains the main body of work. If you would like to interact and edit the contents please be advised that you should have the following requirements:

1. Download and Install Anaconda latest release from it's official and licensed source. The anaconda package includes the python code and the packages (libraries) needed for the computation and visualisation of the contetnts of the Tasks.ipynb file.

2. Open the CLI or cmd on the machine navigate to the required directory insert `$ git clone` `link of the repository`

3. insert `jupyter notebook`

4. A web browser is automatically initiated, where you can see the file `Tasks.ipynb`
